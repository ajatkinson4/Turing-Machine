# Turing-Machine

`Idea`
The Turing machine for the binary addition problem works by reading the input string from left to right, using the '+' and '=' symbols to divide the input into three parts: the left operand, the right operand, and the result. It then moves back to the '+' symbol and checks that the left operand and the right operand are the same, using the binary digits '0' and '1' to compare each position in the operands. If the operands are equal, the Turing machine moves to the accepting state, indicating that the input string is a valid binary addition problem. If the operands are not equal, the Turing machine moves to the rejecting state, indicating that the input string is not a valid binary addition problem.
